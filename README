Roundcube plugin
----------------
identities_aliases v1.1.2
=========================

A simple roundcube plugin to manage local aliases and create temporary
emails easily.

This generate automatically an email when you add a new one throught
Settings->Identities and the + (add) button. It will generate a text
file that you can include separately in your postfix config and start
a sudo command to update it's internal database when needed.

All comments are welcome.
